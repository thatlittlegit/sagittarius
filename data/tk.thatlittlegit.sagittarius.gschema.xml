      <description>
        The plugins that should be enabled by Sagittarius on startup. By
        default, all of the built-in plugins (about, file, Gemini, text). Note
        that the user needs to activate any plugins they install. Also note that
        this key may change over time, given the lack of support for differing
        directories (it can't tell the difference between
        /usr/share/sagittarius/libabout and
        ~/.local/share/sagittarius/plugins/libabout).

      <description>
        A list of content types the user has configured. If this is set at all,
        then the defaults won't be written; in a major update, it might be
        necessary to reset them. (In this case, perhaps the developer should
        change the name of the plugin.)
